## Overview
Diagnosify is built using machine learning algorithms and aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing a secondary diagnostic tool for common diseases. With a user-friendly Streamlit interface, users can enter health metrics and get a probabilistic assessment of specific diseases, aiding in early detection and preventive care.

## Features
- **Multi-Disease Prediction**: Predicts the risk of multiple diseases, such as:
  - Diabetes
  - Heart Disease
  - Parkinson's Disease
  - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
  - Kidney Disease
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Accessible via a web application built with Streamlit for seamless interaction.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Provides immediate results based on input health metrics.
- **Secure and Scalable**: Designed to be deployed on Streamlit Cloud, with the ability to scale and integrate with more data.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Main programming language for building the app and models.
- **Streamlit**: Framework used to build the web application.
- **Scikit-Learn** and **Joblib**: For machine learning model building and serialization.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: Data processing and manipulation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used during the initial model development and testing.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries for analysis.
